## Waterfall

For which of the following scenarios is the Waterfall model most appropriate?

- [n] While working with the Junior Entreprise EPFL, a talented web developer has to work on a new project with a client who wants a website for his company.

- [y] The Volare Space Robotics Challenge was a contest organized by the ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana) and ESA (European Space Agency). The goal was to make high-school students design robots that unload cargo from ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle, while avoiding objects.
