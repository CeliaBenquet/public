## The role of software in modern life

Which of the following attributes of a software system are not among the key properties we will concern ourselves with in this course?

- [n] Safety
- [n] Security
- [y] Cost 
- [y] Usability 
- [n] Performance
- [n] Manageability
- [n] Reliability

How many lines of code (LOC) are in the software of systems like the Boeing 767 avionics or a modern premium automobile?

- [n] Thousands
- [n] Tens of thousands
- [n] Hundreds of thousands
- [y] Millions 

If a software system is deemed to be 100% safe, then is it allowed to ever fail?

- [y] Yes 
- [n] No

can fail without catastrophic consequences

A secure system is one that protects user information from... (check all that apply)

- [y] theft 
- [y] unauthorized access 
- [n] duplication => as part of backup operations / data replication 
- [y] tampering 
- [n] being used in erroneous calculations=> not security : can do whatever wants as long as has the access

## The challenge of software complexity

Which statements are correct regarding tests and proofs?

- [y] Tests cannot cover a significant fraction of a large program's behaviors, because each test can only verify one behavior at a time 
- [n] Testing is slow because the result of each test has to be inspected for correctness
- [y] Proof techniques can verify programs with respect to low-level properties (such as division by zero) 
- [y] Proof techniques can verify higher-level properties (so called functional properties) 

Is it possible to have a program with an infinite number of paths?

- [n] No, because the number of paths is exponential in the program size, and the program size is always finite
- [n] No, because a program always terminates eventually
- [y] Yes, if the program has a loop that never ends (e.g., a server listening loop) 
- [n] Yes, if the program runs on a 64-bit processor.

## Preventing and finding errors early

In practice, which part of the software development process takes the most time?

- [n] Problem definition and requirements analysis
- [n] Software architecture and design
- [n] Coding
- [y] Testing and debugging 
- [n] Integration and maintenance

Ideally, which part of the software development should take the least time?

- [n] Problem definition and requirements analysis
- [n] Software architecture and design
- [n] Coding
- [n] Testing
- [y] Debugging 

## Building Software

Where do you define the expectations a user has from a software project?

- [n] Problem statement
- [y] Functional specification 
- [n] Software architecture

An earlier version of this class had a different type of project. The SwEng homeworks each presented new feature requirements, such that at the end of the semester a team had implemented a complete Android application. Which software building approach would best fit this model?

- [n] Block approach
- [y] Agile approach 
- [n] None of the above

## Version Control Systems

Suppose a developer wants to cancel the changes they made to a piece of code and revert to a previous version. However, the developer is on a train, without access to the internet. This can be done in:

- [n] First generation version control systems, or later
- [n] Second generation version control systems, or later
- [y] Third generation version control systems 
- [n] No current version control system supports this scenario

Which VCS does not require merging modifications?

- [y] Locking VCS (first generation) 
- [n] Decentralized VCS(third generation)
- [n] Centralized VCS(second generation)
