We provide you a simple Android app: the user can enter their name, then press a button, and the app will say hi using their name.

Write Android instrumentation tests that enter text in the app, press the button, and check that the displayed greeting is correct. 
The Espresso testing framework provides APIs for writing UI tests to simulate user interactions within a single target app: you can simulate button clicks, verify that a view is displayed, etc... You can read more about it and find some examples [here](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing).
